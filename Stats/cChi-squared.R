# implementation of chi-squared test 
# which checks if two or more attributes are associoated or not (independent)
#
# a chi-square test for independence compares two variables in a contingency table to see if they are related. It tests to see whether distributions of categorical variables differ from each another.
# a very small chi square test statistic means that your observed data fits your expected data extremely well. There is a relationship.
# a very large chi square test statistic means that the data does not fit very well. There isnâ€™t a relationship.
